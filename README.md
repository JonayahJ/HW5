# Work Day Planner

## Steps I took:

* I pseudocoded out my process using the requirements to act as guidelines.

* Then I read up on the moment library and formatted my date.  I displayed it on the page as shown in the README gif.

* I added the html and css for the time blocks.

* I found a function that would return the user's current time.

* Based on the current time, I color coded the rows to match whether or not it the time of day had passed.

* I then added a function to the save button to get the descriptions from the hour blocks and added them into the local storage.

## Comments

So, I added all of my JavaScript and jQuery to the html file because I was having trouble with my script.js file.  Even though it was linked to the index.html file and the external links were there (and in the right order), it didn't work.  I'm not sure why.  So all of my jQuery is in the same file as the html.
